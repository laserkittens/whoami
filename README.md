This account is a pointer to [my danzek account, go there](https://github.com/danzek) instead of here.

## Why?

Because I wanted to make a GitHub Pages site with the laserkittens subdomain.

## But why would you make a *third* account?

Because I can.

## I still don't understand

    User* me = &danzek;

### Oh I get it now! But I don't appreciate your asterisk placement in that code example

Hear, oh disciple, [the words of Bjarne Stroustrup](http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq2.html#whitespace).
